% Based on an example from the Global Constraint Catalog, 2nd Edition, Revision A

% The example consists of six rectangles and has only one solution, see p. 1040.

% We add additional vertical lines, horizontal lines, and points to check that
% these get placed correctly, too.

% additional vertical lines

% additional horizontal lines
